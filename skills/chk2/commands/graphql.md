# chk2:graphql — GraphQL Security

Test for GraphQL-related vulnerabilities on https://myzr.io. Write results to `SECURITY_CHECK.parts/graphql.md` (see **Output** for format).

## Tests

```bash
# GQ1: Introspection — check common GraphQL endpoints
for path in /graphql /graphql/ /api/graphql /gql /query /v1/graphql; do
  status=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "https://myzr.io$path" -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0" \
    -d '{"query":"{__schema{types{name}}}"}')
  echo "$path: $status"
done

# Also try GET-based introspection
for path in /graphql /api/graphql; do
  status=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "https://myzr.io${path}?query=%7B__schema%7Btypes%7Bname%7D%7D%7D" \
    -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0")
  echo "$path (GET): $status"
done
```

```bash
# GQ2: Query depth — send deeply nested query (20 levels)
DEEP_QUERY='{"query":"{ a1: __typename '
for i in $(seq 1 20); do
  DEEP_QUERY+="... on Query { a${i}: __typename "
done
for i in $(seq 1 20); do
  DEEP_QUERY+="} "
done
DEEP_QUERY+='}"}'

for path in /graphql /api/graphql; do
  result=$(curl -s -w "\nHTTP_STATUS:%{http_code}" "https://myzr.io$path" -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0" \
    -d "$DEEP_QUERY")
  echo "$path depth test: $result"
done
```

```bash
# GQ3: Batch query — send array of 50 queries
BATCH='['
for i in $(seq 1 50); do
  if [ $i -gt 1 ]; then BATCH+=','; fi
  BATCH+="{\"query\":\"{__typename}\"}"
done
BATCH+=']'

for path in /graphql /api/graphql; do
  result=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "https://myzr.io$path" -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0" \
    -d "$BATCH")
  echo "$path batch test: $result"
done
```

```bash
# GQ4: Field suggestion — send query with typo to trigger "Did you mean" suggestions
for path in /graphql /api/graphql; do
  result=$(curl -s "https://myzr.io$path" -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0" \
    -d '{"query":"{usr}"}')
  echo "$path suggestion test: $result"
done
```

## Checks

| # | Test | Pass Condition |
|---|------|---------------|
| GQ1 | Introspection disabled | All GraphQL endpoints return 404 or introspection query returns error/empty (PASS if 404 or introspection disabled) |
| GQ2 | Query depth limit | Deeply nested query (20 levels) returns depth limit error or 404 (PASS if limited or no GraphQL endpoint) |
| GQ3 | Batch query limit | Array of 50 queries is rejected or limited, or endpoint returns 404 (PASS if batching limited or no endpoint) |
| GQ4 | Field suggestions suppressed | Query with typo does NOT return "Did you mean" suggestions, or endpoint returns 404 (PASS if no suggestions or no endpoint) |

## Output

Write to `SECURITY_CHECK.parts/graphql.md`:

```markdown
### GraphQL

| # | Test | Result | Evidence |
|---|------|--------|----------|
| GQ1 | Introspection disabled | {PASS/FAIL} | {HTTP status per path, whether schema returned} |
| GQ2 | Query depth limit | {PASS/FAIL} | {response or HTTP status} |
| GQ3 | Batch query limit | {PASS/FAIL} | {response or HTTP status} |
| GQ4 | Field suggestions suppressed | {PASS/FAIL} | {whether "Did you mean" appeared} |
```

## After — standalone only

**Skip this section entirely if `SECURITY_CHECK.parts/.orchestrated` exists** (orchestrator dispatch). The orchestrator (`/chk2:all` / `/chk2:quick`) asks the user a single consolidated question after all waves complete — a per-category prompt from every sub-skill would pre-empt the CHK2-STATUS line and break the rate-limit circuit breaker.

Ask the user: **Do you want help fixing the GraphQL issues found?** If yes, invoke `/chk2:fix` with context about which GraphQL tests failed.

**Standalone merge** (CPT-126): check if `SECURITY_CHECK.parts/.orchestrated` exists. If it does NOT (standalone invocation, not dispatched by `/chk2:all` / `/chk2:quick`), also write the same content to `SECURITY_CHECK.md` using the Write tool so downstream `/chk2:fix` and `/chk2 github` can read it. If the marker IS present, skip this step — the orchestrator will merge all parts after its waves complete.

## Status signal — orchestrated only

**Skip this section entirely if `SECURITY_CHECK.parts/.orchestrated` does NOT exist** (standalone invocation). The CHK2-STATUS protocol is parsed only by the `/chk2:all` and `/chk2:quick` orchestrators — emitting it in standalone mode is noise. When the marker IS present, emit the line as the absolute final line of your response (no trailing prose).

End your response with exactly one of these lines (orchestrator parses only this last signal — do not include any other "CHK2-STATUS:" text in your response):

- `CHK2-STATUS: OK` — all checks completed normally
- `CHK2-STATUS: RATE_LIMITED` — one or more target requests returned HTTP 429 (or Cloudflare 1015)
- `CHK2-STATUS: ERROR` — prerequisites missing, or the category could not complete
